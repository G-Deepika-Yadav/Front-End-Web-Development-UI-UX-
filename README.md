Project Title: 	To-Do List Application

DESCRIPTION :  

Our project is a To-Do List Application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. The main goal of this project is to create a simple and user-friendly interface for organizing daily work or personal tasks.
We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend to provide a clean and responsive design. For the backend, we used JavaScript to handle user interactions and manage task data.
In this application, users can enter their tasks, set deadlines, mark them as completed, and delete them when no longer needed. The interface is visually clean and easy to navigate, making it simple for anyone to use.
We have also added visual elements like icons and styled buttons to improve the user experience. The application is fully open source and can be easily customized or expanded as needed.
This project helps improve productivity, encourages better time management, and is suitable for both personal and professional use.
